                    <p>With 15 years of experience in London’s luxury hotels, a title of World Champion Pastry Chef, a
                        contestant on MasterChef, and recognized expertise in the world of high-end Catering and

                    <p>“No deconstruction in my cooking; I want the customer to rediscover the shape and taste of the
                        product. A return to essentials but with modern cooking techniques and contemporary plating.
                        Tradition and Modernity are not incompatible!”</p>
